Stir it all together, bring it to a simmer then reduce the heat to low. Put a lid on the pot and let it simmer for half an hour. The mixture should be soft and thick after a half hour.

Flip the dough and cook the other side until golden brown as well. Serve plain or brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with herbs!\nTIPS: For the most bubbles, don't roll out the ball of dough until just before it is ready to be placed in the skillet.

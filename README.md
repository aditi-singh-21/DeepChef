# DeepChef

DeepChef is an innovative recipe recommendation system designed to assist users in finding the most relevant and visually appealing recipes based on their input. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques and a comprehensive dataset of recipe images, DeepChef ensures a seamless and engaging user experience.

## ðŸ“œ **Project Overview**

The core idea behind DeepChef is to provide accurate recipe recommendations by analyzing and comparing dish images. The project includes web scraping to gather data, image encoding for feature extraction, and a Django web application for user interaction.

### **Key Features:**
- **Comprehensive Dataset:** 
  - 3,360 images of various dishes collected from the Food.com website.
  - 336 recipes, including detailed ingredients and cooking instructions.
- **Data Collection & Cleaning:** 
  - Web scraping was performed using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
  - Collected recipe data was meticulously cleaned using Python.
- **Image Encoding:** 
  - DenseNet 201, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network, was used for efficient image feature extraction.
- **Recipe Recommendation:** 
  - Cosine Similarity was employed to match and recommend the top five similar recipes based on input images with 90% accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** 
  - A Django-based web application provides an intuitive platform for users to search and explore recommended recipes effortlessly.
